## Introduction

Static PHP Builds provides precompiled PHP for [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev). With Static PHP Builds, installing PHP is a download instead of a compile — each release includes the PHP CLI, Composer, and Xdebug, for Linux x86_64 and Linux aarch64.

The builds are not tied to a framework. They include the extensions that Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, and most other PHP applications need: database drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server, Redis and MongoDB clients, image processing with GD and Imagick, intl, sodium, and more.

The full list of extensions compiled into every build is in [`config/extensions.txt`](config/extensions.txt). Linux builds run on any distribution with glibc 2.17 or newer.

## Installation

First, you should point mise's `php` tool at this repository:

```sh
mise tool-alias set php github:nunomaduro/static-php-builds
```

Once configured, you may install and use PHP like any other mise tool:

```sh
mise use --global php@8.5

php -v
composer --version
```

Projects that pin a PHP version in their `mise.toml` file use these builds as well:

```toml
[tools]
php = "8.4"
```

Alpha, beta, and release candidate versions of the next PHP release, such as `8.6.0beta3`, install the same way. `php@latest` always resolves to the newest stable release:

```sh
mise use --global php@8.6.0beta3
```

## Xdebug

Xdebug is loaded in every build, but it is turned off by default, so PHP runs at full speed. To enable it, set the `XDEBUG_MODE` environment variable to the [modes](https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#mode) you need, such as `debug` for step debugging or `coverage` for code coverage. `XDEBUG_MODE` always takes precedence over the bundled configuration, so you never need to edit files inside mise's install directory.

To enable Xdebug for a single command, set the variable inline:

```sh
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text
```

To enable Xdebug for a project, add the variable to the project's `mise.toml` file. mise sets it whenever you are inside that directory:

```toml
[env]
XDEBUG_MODE = "debug"
```

To enable Xdebug everywhere, export the variable from your shell's startup file, such as `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
export XDEBUG_MODE=debug
```

You may enable several modes at once by separating them with commas, such as `XDEBUG_MODE=debug,coverage`.

### Step Debugging

With `XDEBUG_MODE=debug` set, start listening for debug connections in your editor (the "PHP Debug" extension in VS Code, or "Start Listening for PHP Debug Connections" in PhpStorm), then trigger a debugging session:

- **Console commands:** set the `XDEBUG_TRIGGER` environment variable, e.g. `XDEBUG_MODE=debug XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1 php script.php`.
- **Browser requests:** use a browser extension such as Xdebug Helper, which sets the `XDEBUG_SESSION` cookie. When using a server built on PHP's built-in web server, such as `php -S localhost:8000 -t public` or `php artisan serve`, set `XDEBUG_MODE` before starting the server so the requests it serves inherit it.

If you would like every request and command to connect to your editor without a trigger, also set `XDEBUG_CONFIG="start_with_request=yes"`.

The `bin/php` wrapper adds `etc/php/conf.d` to `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR`, so any scan directory you configure yourself is still read.

## Verifying a Download

Every release file carries a GitHub build attestation, which mise verifies automatically. If you would like to verify a download yourself, you may use the `gh attestation verify` command:

```sh
gh attestation verify php-8.5.10-linux-x86_64.tar.gz --repo nunomaduro/static-php-builds
```

Each release also includes a `SHA256SUMS` file with the digest of every tarball:

```sh
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS
```

## How Releases Are Built

A scheduled workflow runs every day at 09:00 UTC. For each branch in [`config/php-branches.txt`](config/php-branches.txt), it looks up the newest release on php.net and builds it only if this repository does not have a release for it yet. A branch without a stable release, such as 8.6 before its general availability, uses its newest pre-release from qa.php.net:

1. The PHP source is downloaded from php.net and verified against the SHA-256 that php.net publishes.
2. PHP is compiled with a pinned, checksum-verified [static-php-cli](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli) on GitHub-hosted runners.
3. Each build is unpacked and smoke tested: the PHP version, the extensions, Xdebug, Composer, SQLite, intl, HTTPS with the system CA certificates, and the glibc baseline.
4. The files receive a build attestation and are published as a GitHub release named after the PHP version.

All pinned versions and checksums live in [`config/build.env`](config/build.env). The checksum of every other source that went into a build is recorded in the release's `share/sources.txt` file.

Security releases of PHP follow the same schedule, so they are built within a day of being published on php.net.

### Building Releases Manually

You may also run the **Release** workflow yourself. The `version` input accepts a PHP branch, an exact version, or `all`:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=8.5
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=8.6.0beta3
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=all
```

`all` builds the newest release of every branch, including the releases that are already published. Leaving `version` empty builds only the releases that are missing, the same as the schedule.

By default, a manual run only builds and smoke tests. If you would like to publish the result as a GitHub release, pass the `publish` input as well. A version that is already published is left as it is, because releases in this repository cannot change after they are published:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=all -f publish=true
```

### Building Locally

To check that a build works on your own Linux machine, run `bin/build` with a PHP branch or version. It resolves the newest release on php.net, builds it for your CPU architecture, and smoke tests the result:

```sh
bin/build 8.4
```

The tarball lands in `dist/`. The first run installs the build tools that static-php-cli needs, which may ask for your password.

## Release Layout

Each tarball unpacks to the following layout:

```
bin/php                          # runs libexec/php with the bundled ini files
bin/composer
libexec/php                      # the PHP binary
libexec/composer.phar
lib/php/extensions/xdebug.so
etc/php/conf.d/xdebug.ini
share/licenses/                  # licenses of PHP and every bundled library
share/build-info.txt
share/sources.txt                # SHA-256 of every source archive and commit of every git source in the build
```
